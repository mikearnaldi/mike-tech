## Background

I'm Michael Arnaldi, Founder and CEO of Effectful Technologies — the company behind Effect, the TypeScript library for building production-grade systems. I've been programming for most of my life. I started at 11 years old with the goal of cracking video games. Since then, I've written code at every level imaginable: from kernel-level development to the highest abstractions in TypeScript.

Programming has been my life. And now it's gone for good.

Let me explain.

## The Ralph Wiggum Moment

The broader community is just now realizing the power of AI. Last week, "Ralph Wiggum" went viral. Ralph is a technique that prompts agents like Claude Code in a deterministic loop to iteratively build large systems from lists of small tasks. Twitter exploded with discussions about it.

The name comes from [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/), a great engineer and a good friend who's been exploring the extremes of AI for a long time.

What people don't realize is that this is just the beginning. The "AI power users" are already working with far more refined techniques — and they're not just building simple things. They're cloning entire companies in hours.

## A Real Example

I've always been passionate about finance. I used to be a [regulated person](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/individual?id=0030X00002TQAcfQAH) — an executive director in a firm that created derivative products. Since moving on from that life, I still have the occasional urge to check macroeconomic data.

A few weeks ago, I set myself the goal of analyzing Polymarket. I wanted to spot insider trading, whale activity, derive volatility — a bunch of crazy stuff that only a finance nerd would want. In finance, there's an amazing tool that everybody serious enough ends up using: the [Bloomberg Terminal](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal). It's so popular that the number of terminals per capita is used as a metric to understand financial activity in countries. And for that, the winner is New York! Nope — it's actually Vatican City, with 1.9% of people having a terminal. Almost 4x what Luxembourg has.

There's only one problem with the Bloomberg Terminal — it's fucking expensive. And it's old and clunky in various ways.

So I decided to "Ralph my way" and build a modern Bloomberg Terminal for Polymarket.

It took me 2 hours. I wrote 0 lines of code. I reviewed 0 lines of code.

## What Is Software Development?

If an idiot like me can clone a product that people pay $30k per month to use — in two hours — what is software development?

It's an interesting question. Software development used to be a craft. Something only a few people could do well. Now everybody can be a software developer.

A friend of mine with a legal background and almost no coding experience built a full-blown compliance solution to check privacy policies against the GDPR. He didn't use tools like Lovable — he hacked it by chatting with Claude Code, using Effect and Next.js. I've checked the code. It's good.

The new software developer is no longer a craftsman. It's the average operator, empowered.
