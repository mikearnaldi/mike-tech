## Background

I'm Michael Arnaldi, Founder and CEO of Effectful Technologies — the company behind Effect, the TypeScript library for building production-grade systems. I've been programming most of my life. I started at 11 with the goal of cracking video games. Since then, I've written code at every level: from kernel development to the highest abstractions in TypeScript.

Programming has been my life. And now it's gone for good.

Let me explain.

## The Ralph Wiggum Moment

The broader community is only now waking up to the power of AI. Last week, [Ralph Wiggum](https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/2007924876548637089) went viral. Ralph is a technique that prompts agents like Claude Code in a deterministic loop, iteratively building large systems from lists of small tasks. Twitter exploded.

The name comes from [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/), a great engineer and a good friend who's been exploring the extremes of AI for a long time.

What people don't realize is that this is just the beginning. The "AI power users" are already working with far more refined techniques — and they're not just building simple things. They're cloning entire companies in hours.

## A Real Example

I've always been passionate about finance. I used to be a [regulated person](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/individual?id=0030X00002TQAcfQAH) — an executive director at a firm that created derivative products. Since moving on, I still get the occasional urge to check macroeconomic data.

A few weeks ago, I decided to analyze Polymarket. I wanted to spot insider trading, whale activity, derive volatility — the kind of stuff only a finance nerd would care about. In finance, there's one tool that everybody serious ends up using: the [Bloomberg Terminal](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal). It's so ubiquitous that terminals per capita is used as a metric for financial activity. And for that, the winner is New York! Nope — it's actually Vatican City, with 1.9% of people having a terminal. Almost 4x Luxembourg.

There's only one problem with the Bloomberg Terminal — it's fucking expensive. And old. And clunky.

So I decided to "Ralph my way" and build a modern Bloomberg Terminal for Polymarket.

It took me 2 hours. I wrote 0 lines of code. I reviewed 0 lines of code.

## What Is Software Development?

If an idiot like me can clone a product that costs $30k per month — in two hours — what even is software development?

It's an interesting question. Software development used to be a craft. Something only a few people could do well. Now anyone can be a software developer.

A friend of mine with a legal background and almost no coding experience built a full-blown compliance solution to check privacy policies against the GDPR. He didn't use tools like Lovable — he hacked it by chatting with Claude Code, using Effect and Next.js. I checked the code. It's good.

The new software developer is no longer a craftsman. It's the average operator, empowered.

## The Economic Impact

We are living through the Industrial Revolution of Software.

We're moving from a world where software is scarce to one where it's abundant and cheap. The economic implications are drastic — and poorly understood.

That will be the topic of my next post.
